## Cultivating Creativity in Data Work

#### Abstract

Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations, proofs of statistical tests, and the general correctness of what methods to use for certain applications. However, this is only one dimension of the practice of doing analysis. Other dimensions include the technical mastery of a language and tooling system, and most importantly the construction of a convicing narrative tailored to a specific audience, with the ultimate goal of them accepting the analysis. These "softer" aspects of analysis are difficult to teach, perhaps moreso when the field is framed as mathematics and often housed in mathematics departments. In this talk, I discuss an alternative framework for viewing the field and ways to cultivate and hone the creative lens so necessary to the success of applied work.
